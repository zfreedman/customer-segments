Unsupervised learning to describe customers based on categorical expenditure

# Description
This repo contains the code for clustering customers based on their spending habits. Specifically, the goal is to
investigate spending for distributors to see if changing the supplier's delivery schedule to said distributors will
have a positive or negative impact. Additionally, this unsupervised learning task aims to figure out how changes
in supply schedule will affect distinct customer groups differently.
